Ferre Newlink E-commerce üèóÔ∏èüõí

Welcome to the Ferre Newlink Store Project repository! üëã This project is a complete online store developed for "Ferre Newlink," a fictional hardware store. It was a pivotal project in my learning journey, where I applied and consolidated a wide range of skills in React for the frontend and Firebase for the backend and data management.

This website is not just an attractive user interface; it also integrates crucial e-commerce and authentication functionalities, demonstrating my ability to build robust and dynamic web applications.

Project Goal & Key Learnings üéØ
Developing the Ferre Newlink online store was an intensive experience that allowed me to learn and apply the following concepts:

React Component Development: Building a modular and reusable user interface, a cornerstone of React.
State Management with React Context: Efficiently handling the application's global state (e.g., user or shopping cart state) without needing additional libraries.
User Authentication with Firebase: Implementing secure login systems using email/password and Google accounts (OAuth).
NoSQL Database with Firebase (Firestore): Creating and managing a database to store and link product information (name, description, price, image) directly with the website.
Routing with React Router: Seamless navigation between different store sections and pages.
Advanced Styling with Sass: Using Sass for more efficient and powerful style organization.

Highlighted Store Features ‚ú®

Homepage and Product Catalog: Displays Ferre Newlink's categories and products.
Category Pages: Shows products filtered by specific categories.
Product Detail: Interactive product card components.
Shopping Cart: Full functionality to add, remove, and adjust product quantities in the cart.
Checkout Page: Order summary and preparation for purchase completion.
Complete Authentication System:
New user registration.
Email and password login.
Google account login (Google Sign-In).
User session persistence.
Firebase Integration:
Authentication: For user management.
Firestore Database: For storing product and other relevant data.
Modular and Scalable Design: Built with reusable React components to facilitate future expansions.

Technologies Used üíª

Frontend:
React: The main library for building the user interface.
React Router: For routing and navigation management.
Sass (SCSS): For robust and modular CSS preprocessing.
HTML & CSS: The essential foundations.

Backend & Database:
Firebase Authentication: For user management and authentication.
Firestore Database: NoSQL database for storing product information and other relevant data.
Lessons Deepened üß†
This project allowed me to dive deep into several critical aspects of modern web development:

React Component Usage: How to break down a complex UI into small, manageable components.
Global State Management: Understanding when and how to use React Context to avoid "prop drilling."
Secure Authentication Flows: Practical implementation of different authentication methods and user session handling.
Data Modeling and Persistence: Designing data schemas in Firestore and how to link database data with the user interface.
API Consumption (Firebase): Bidirectional interaction with backend services to fetch, add, and update data.

Installation and Running the Project ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

To explore the Ferre Newlink website on your machine:

Clone the repository:
Bash

git clone https://github.com/wfmendez/ferre-newlink-store-project.git
Navigate to the project directory:
Bash

cd ferre-newlink-store-project
Install dependencies:
Bash

npm install
# or if you use yarn
# yarn install
Configure Firebase: You'll need to create a project in Firebase, enable Authentication (Email/Password and Google) and Firestore, then configure your Firebase project credentials in an .env file or directly in your code (make sure not to upload sensitive keys to public repositories).
Run the application:
Bash

npm start
# or if you use yarn
# yarn start
This will open the website in your browser (usually at http://localhost:3000).
